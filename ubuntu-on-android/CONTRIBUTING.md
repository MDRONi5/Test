## Getting started
### ubuntu-on-android
ubuntu-on-android repository aimed to custom ubuntu tarballs with the pre-installed applications for general usage. The idea is to provide pc like experience by keeping in mind about drawbacks of proot ( which udroid works on ).
For starters, ubuntu-on-android doesn't hold the major code part of udroid. ubuntu-on-android has the installer, some beginner markdown guides, and preview images.
here is the list of all repos and their description that are part of udroid.

> https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/udroid-wiki

### fs-cook

## How can I contribute
for starters, you can follow the basic GitHub guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

When submitting a pull request make sure to add a good title and description to it. using images is encouraged too

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
```
$ git commit -m "A summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding conventions
Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:
* use 4-6 spaces for intending to bash
* follow directory rules in all cases ( images should go in directories named similar to `assets` or `img` )
* use code beautification tools for better look and readability
* This is open-source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers, the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
